Show your name, surname, bio, contacts on the main page
 Create basic django-project that would present your name, surname, date of birth, bio, contacts on the main page. Data should be stored in the DB, that's

    manage.py syncdb
    manage.py runserver
    open the browser and all data are in, loaded from fixtures 

Add superuser with login: admin pass: admin via fixtures

Use pip requirements and virtualenv to manage your third party packages dependencies

Use south, you'll need it later

There should be Makefile with test target running your tests (make test to verify it)
